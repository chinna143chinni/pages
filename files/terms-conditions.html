            </ul>
            <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
            <p>It is important to understand that when you make a payment to book a celebrity for an event or
                appearance, it is a serious commitment that cannot be taken lightly. Celebrity appearances are often
                expensive and require significant planning and coordination. As such, most celebrity booking agencies
                have strict refund policies in place to protect themselves and the celebrities they represent.
                One common policy is that once you have paid for a celebrity appearance, there will be no refunds
                granted in any case. This means that if you decide to cancel the event or appearance for any reason, you
                will not be able to get your money back.</p>
            <p>There are several reasons for this type of policy. Firstly, the celebrity may have already blocked off
                their schedule for your event, which means that they have turned down other opportunities in order to
                fulfill their commitment to you. If you cancel the event, the celebrity may not be able to book another
                gig on short notice, which can be detrimental to their career.
                In addition, the booking agency may have already incurred expenses related to the event, such as travel
                and accommodation costs for the celebrity, which cannot be refunded. These expenses are often
                non-refundable, and the agency cannot absorb the cost of these expenses if the event is cancelled.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that some booking agencies may offer a rescheduling option, where you can
                postpone the event to a later date, without losing your deposit or full payment. However, this is
                subject to the availability of the celebrity and their willingness to reschedule.

                Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly research and consider all aspects of your event before making a
                commitment to book a celebrity appearance. This includes ensuring that you have the necessary resources
                and support to successfully execute the event, and that you have thoroughly vetted the celebrity's
                availability and suitability for your event.

                In conclusion, while it may be disappointing to not be able to get a refund for a celebrity appearance,
                it is important to remember that it is a serious commitment that cannot be taken lightly. By
                understanding and respecting the booking agency's refund policy, you can ensure a smooth and successful
                event.</p>
